## Introduction
Welcome to my blog post! In this article, we will explore the concept of equilibrium and its different types. Let's dive into the fascinating world of physics!

## What is Equilibrium?
Equilibrium refers to a state where the net force and net torque acting on an object are both zero. In this state, the object experiences a balanced condition, with no acceleration or rotation.

## Types of Equilibrium
There are three main types of equilibrium:

1. **Static Equilibrium**: In static equilibrium, an object remains at rest and does not move. The sum of all forces and torques acting on the object is zero. It can be further divided into two subtypes:
   - *Translational Equilibrium*: The forces acting on the object balance each other, resulting in zero net force.
   - *Rotational Equilibrium*: The torques acting on the object balance each other, resulting in zero net torque.

2. **Dynamic Equilibrium**: In dynamic equilibrium, an object is in motion but at a constant velocity. The net force acting on the object is zero, providing a balance between external forces and frictional forces.

3. **Stable Equilibrium**: In stable equilibrium, a small displacement from the equilibrium position results in a restoring force or torque that brings the object back to its original position.

## Examples of Equilibrium
Equilibrium can be observed in various everyday scenarios, such as:

- A book resting on a flat table
- A pendulum at its lowest point of swing
- A ball rolling down a frictionless hill at a constant speed
